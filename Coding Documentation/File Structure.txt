File is largely a text file, with *.escc extension. Entries are terminated with a 0x0A byte (Apple Mac style EOL marker). Backups are *.escc.back.
First line will be the file version number (NOT application version number). This is used to check compatability. Currently, this is 0.05.
Next five lines are a header.
Line 7 is empty.
From line 8 are the various parts of the data, each with a single line header describing the data which follows.
Each line is a separate entry of data. Each entry will relate to the global variable structure. The following sections do not need to be in this order, but MUST be indicated by the header text.

Note - in the code, the reference to the Author is increased by one when loaded and decreased by one when saved. This is because the first element of the MembersList array is a special one, where no author is selelected. Therefore, expect to find an entry of '-1'.
