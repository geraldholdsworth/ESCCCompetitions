# ESCCCompetitions
 Competitions application for the East Sutherland Camera Club<br>
<br>
This application is used to take votes, on the night, collate them and work out the scores and winners for each competition held by the East Sutherland Camera Club (https://www.eastsutherlandcc.org.uk). It also calculates, from these results, the scores and, hence, Photographers of the Year.<br>
